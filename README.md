## Mission Statement

#### SDG and general problem domain:
The SDG we are aiming to solve is quality education. Specifically, we are targeting the
issue of lack of resources, such as learning supplies. 

#### How might we...
How might we provide more teaching/learning resources for K-8 schools in rural
areas?

## Why we are building it
We will serve as a middleman to connect schools/teachers with donors for their needs of technologies and teaching
resources. 

## What we are building

### P0:
* Resource Board Page (schools can post about their needs of physical resources)

  *   School Name

  *   User Email
  *   School Address
  *   Resources Needed
  *   Deadline for Resources
  *   Notes

### P1:
* Process bar (to show users how many resources are still needed)
* Sort and filter tutors (adds up to display tutor page)
* Verify school with a recognized accrediting body or Educational Service District (ESD).
