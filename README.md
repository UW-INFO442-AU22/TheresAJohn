## Mission Statement

This application aims to serve as a middleman between schools/teachers with donors so that donors can help support local schools in their needs of teaching resources. 

This solution addresses UN’s Sustainable Development Goal: Quality education. Lack of resources in schools hinders a student’s learning opportunities.
 

## What we are building

### P0:
* Resource Board Page (schools can post about their needs of physical resources)
* Running Database: 
  *   School Name
  *   User Name
  *   User Email
  *   School Address
  *   Resources Needed
  *   Deadline for Resources
  *   Notes 
* School/user log-in/authentication

### P1:
* Process bar (to show users how many resources are still needed)
* Sort and filter tutors (adds up to display tutor page)
* Verify school with a recognized accrediting body or Educational Service District (ESD).

## Deployment Instructions
