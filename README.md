# TheresAJohn - Website for rural area K-8 students

## Why we are building it

According to our research, the root cause of education inequality in rural areas shares
commonality worldwide, e.g., in the US, China, and Vietnam. Therefore, we aim to
provide a platform that addresses these problems to benefit a global population; we
strive to focus our attention on K-12 schools in rural areas across the globe. In addition,
we are targeting a lack of courses offered and a lack of technologies.
We will serve as a middleman to connect schools with online volunteer tutors who will
address the lack of courses offered and give our volunteers a lower barrier to help with
education equity problems by easing their burden of traveling and related fees.
We will also have a board for schools and teachers to post technologies and teaching
resources needed and pair them with donors and volunteers.
