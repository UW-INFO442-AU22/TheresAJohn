## Why we are building it

We will serve as a middleman to connect schools with online volunteer tutors who will
address the lack of courses offered and give our volunteers a lower barrier to help with
education equity problems by easing their burden of traveling and related fees.
We will also have a board for schools and teachers to post technologies and teaching
resources needed and pair them with donors and volunteers.
